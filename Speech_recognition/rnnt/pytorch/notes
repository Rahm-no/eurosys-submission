1. List all dangling images:
You can list them first to make sure youâ€™re about to delete the right images:


docker images -f "dangling=true"
2. Delete all dangling images:
Once you've confirmed the list, you can remove all dangling images with the following command:

docker image prune -f

3. Make sure to notice that when you change the number of gpus from 8 to any other number it breaks the shapes ( this should be fixed)
